Description: This package provides functions designed to interact with the BioTIME
    database and it features a sample subset of both the query and meta data, the full
    versions of which are freely available on the BioTIME website -
    https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/home.php .
    The functions provided include the BioTIME recommended methods of gridding and
    rarefaction alongside a selection of standard biodiversity metrics including
    species richness, numerical abundance and exponential Shannon. The resulting
    data frames can then be used to display change over time and examples of these
    are also included.
