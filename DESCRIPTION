Description: The 'BioTIME' database was first published in 
    2018 and inspired ideas, questions, project and research
    article. To make it even more accessible, an R package 
    was created.
    The 'BioTIMEr' package provides tools designed to interact with the
    'BioTIME' database. The functions provided include the 'BioTIME' recommended
    methods for preparing (gridding and rarefaction) time series data, a
    selection of standard biodiversity metrics (including species richness,
    numerical abundance and exponential Shannon) alongside examples on how to
    display change over time. It also includes a sample subset of both the query
    and meta data, the full versions of which are freely available on the 'BioTIME'
    website <https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/home.php>.
