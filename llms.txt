# BioTIMEr

**BioTIMEr** is an R package which gives you functions to work with
BioTIME communities and provides an subset of [the BioTIME
database](https://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/).

**BioTIME** (the Global database of assemblage time series for
quantifying and understanding biodiversity change) is an international
network and an open access database, free to anyone, anywhere in the
world to use for education, research, and conservation.

For a complete description of the database, please refer to our open
access publication entitled [*BioTIME 2.0: Expanding and Improving a
Database of Biodiversity Time
Series.*](https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.70003)

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("BioTIMEr") # CRAN version
```

``` r
remotes::github_install("bioTIMEHub/BioTIMEr", branch = "dev") # dev version
```

## Getting Started

Most BioTIME users are interested in standardising the extent of the
datasets. Here using the data subset included inside the package.

``` r
library(BioTIMEr)
gridding(BTsubset_meta, BTsubset_data)
```

A likely following step would be to rarefy communities to a common
sampling effort.

``` r
gridding(BTsubset_meta, BTsubset_data) |>
   resampling("ABUNDANCE")
```

## Citation

Under the terms of the BioTIME data user agreement, users who download
data agree to cite all underlying DOIs.
