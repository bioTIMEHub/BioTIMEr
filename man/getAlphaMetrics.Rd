Returns a data frame with results for species richness (\code{S}), numerical
 abundance (\code{N}), Maximum Numerical abundance (\code{MaxN}), Shannon Index (\code{Shannon}),

\description{
Calculates a set of standard alpha diversity metrics
}
\details{
The function \code{getAlphaMetrics} computes nine alpha diversity metrics, for a given community data frame, where \code{measure} is a character input specifying the chosen currency field used for the calculations. For each row of the data frame that has any data in it,  \code{getAlphaMetrics} calculates the following metrics:

- Species richness (\code{S}) as the total number of species in each year with currency > 0.

- Numerical abundance (\code{N}) as the total currency (sum) in each year.

- Maximum Numerical abundance as the highest currency value reported in each year.

- Shannon or Shannonâ€“Weaver index is calculated as \eqn{\sum_{i}p_{i}log_{b}p_{i}}, where \eqn{p_{i}} is the proportional abundance of species i and b is the base of the logarithm (natural logarithms), while exponential Shannon is given by \code{exp(Shannon)}.

- Simpson's index is calculated as \eqn{1-sum(p_{i}^{2})}, while Inverse Simpson as \eqn{1/sum(p_{i}^{2})}.

- McNaughton's Dominance is calculated as the sum of the pi of the two most abundant species.

- Probability of intraspecific encounter or PIE is calculated as \eqn{\left(\frac{N}{N-1}\right)\left(1-\sum_{i=1}^{S}\pi_{i}^{2}\right)}.

Note that the input data frame needs to be in the format of the output of the \code{\link{gridding}} function and/or \code{\link{resampling}} function, this includes keeping to the default BioTIME column names. If such columns are not found an error is issued and all operations are halted.
