}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(\code{data.frame}) BioTIME data table in the format of the output of the

Returns a data frame with results for species richness (\code{S}), numerical
 abundance (\code{N}), maximum numerical abundance (\code{maxN}), Shannon Index (\code{Shannon}),
 Exponential Shannon (\code{expShannon}), Simpson's Index (Simpson), Inverse Simpson
 (\code{InvSimpson}), Probability of intraspecific encounter (\code{PIE}) and McNaughton's
 Dominance (\code{DomMc}) for each year and \code{assemblageID}.

\description{
Calculates a set of standard alpha diversity metrics
}
\details{
The function \code{getAlphaMetrics} computes nine alpha diversity metrics for
a given community data frame, where \code{measure} is a character input
specifying the abundance or biomass field used for the calculations. For each
row of the data frame with data, \code{getAlphaMetrics} calculates
the following metrics:

- Species richness (\code{S}) as the total number of species in each year with currency > 0.

- Numerical abundance (\code{N}) as the total currency (sum) in each year
(either total abundance or total biomass).

- Maximum Numerical abundance (maxN) as the highest currency value reported in each year.

- Shannon or Shannonâ€“Weaver index is calculated as \eqn{\sum_{i}p_{i}log_{b}p_{i}}, where \eqn{p_{i}} is the proportional abundance of species i and b is the base of the logarithm (natural logarithms), while exponential Shannon is given by \code{exp(Shannon)}.

- Simpson's index is calculated as \eqn{1-sum(p_{i}^{2})}, while Inverse Simpson as \eqn{1/sum(p_{i}^{2})}.

- McNaughton's Dominance is calculated as the sum of the pi of the two most abundant species.

- Probability of intraspecific encounter or PIE is calculated as \eqn{\left(\frac{N}{N-1}\right)\left(1-\sum_{i=1}^{S}\pi_{i}^{2}\right)}.

Note that the input data frame needs to be in the format of the output of the
 \code{\link{gridding}} function and/or \code{\link{resampling}} functions,
 which includes keeping the default BioTIME data column names. If such columns
 are not found an error is issued and the computations are halted.
