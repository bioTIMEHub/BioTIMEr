\title{Alpha diversity metrics
Calculates a set of standard alpha diversity metrics}
\usage{
getAlphaMetrics(x, measure)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(`data.frame`) BioTIME data table in the format of the output of the
\code{\link{gridding}} function and/or \code{\link{resampling}} function.}

\item{measure}{(`character`) chosen currency defined by a single column name.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with results for species richness (`S`), numerical
 abundance (`N`), Maximum Numerical abundance (`MaxN`), Shannon Index (`Shannon`),
 Exponential Shannon (`expShannon`), Simpson's Index (Simpson), Inverse Simpson
 (`InvSimpson`), Probability of intraspecific encounter (`PIE`) and McNaughton's
 Dominance (`DomMc`) for each year and `assemblageID.`
}
\description{
The function `getAlphaMetrics` computes nine alpha diversity metrics, for a given community data frame, where `measure` is a character input specifying the chosen currency field used for the calculations. For each row of the data frame that has any data in it,  `getAlphaMetrics` calculates the following metrics:

- Species richness (`S`) as the total number of species in each year with currency > 0. 

- Numerical abundance (`N`) as the total currency (sum) in each year.

- Maximum Numerical abundance as the highest currency value reported in each year.

- Shannon or Shannonâ€“Weaver index is calculated as -ipilogbpi, where pi is the proportional abundance of species i and b is the base of the logarithm (natural logarithms), while exponential Shannon is given by `exp(Shannon)`.

- Simpson's index is calculated as 1-sum(pi2), while Inverse Simpson as 1/sum(pi2).

- McNaughton's Dominance is calculated as the sum of the pi of the two most abundant species

- Probability of intraspecific encounter or PIE is calculated as (NN-1)(1-i=1si2).

Note that the input data frame needs to be in the format of the output of the \code{\link{gridding}} function and/or \code{\link{resampling}} function, this includes keeping to the default BioTIME column names. If such columns are not found an error is issued and all operations are halted.
